# Mathematicals
Simple calculators for personal and unpersonal needs

-You can just clone or download the source file and put it into f.exmpl visual studio or rider and run it. Or you can click the releases and download the .exe file from there. There should be a version for linux as well. I hate macs, so compile your mac version on your own (even though I own a max I would dispise to use it)


ALERT: 
Releases aren't currently availble due to lack of maintenance.
